<h3>About Gaspar</h3>
<div id="somos">
	<div class="dupla primera">
		<h4>I am a business graduate and design student at Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. Studying both disciplines has allowed me to complement creativity with a business vision, both necessary in order to thrive in the design world. In my academic years I have developed skills related to new forms of design such as speculative design, bio design, circular economy and service design. I have also gained special interest in social design where the mix of my two areas of expertise can lead to real impact.</h4>

	  	<h4>VioPulp - 2017</h4>
	  	<p>During the initial investigation I identified a bacteria called Janthinobaterium lividum which has the ability to secrete a pigment called Violacein with anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-tumor properties. Most of the existing projects used these bacteria to dye textiles. I saw the opportunity to use it to dye paper.</p>
			<p>After an extensive experimentation I developed VioPulp, a bacterial paper pulp compound. This new material had a property against Botrytis Cinerea, a common fungus found in pears. This quality allowed me to design a packaging for pear transportation. The project was registered in a paper that showed the whole process.</p>

	  	<h4>Veneration Port - 2017</h4>
	  	<p>We observed that today cemeteries are filling up while most of our lives are being captured by social media. We tried to imagine a future where cemeteries where replaced by technological devices.</p>
			<p>The resulting artifact would enable the user to have a connection with the past life of the dead person through his “cloud”. Every time that somebody liked or commented something in the dead person ́s social media, the product would glow, and every day its size would change according to the amount of interactions. The final prototype functions through programmation in Arduino and Python.</p>

	  	<h4>Habitaciones afuera (Outdoor Rooms) - 2015</h4>
	  	<p>We noticed the unnoted presence of homeless people, and realized that they are a fundamental actor in the ecosystem. Throughout an exhaustive ethnographic study we became familiar with what they did, felt and thought.</p>
<p>The result was an intervention co-designed with them:
it consisted of drawings they made on the wall depicting what each space meant to them. This was the initial point for a number of interesting questions and reflections related to the subject.</p>

	  	<h4>Re-Ciclo - 2017</h4>
	  	<p>The project started with ethnographic studies of recycling points, their staff, and their users. Our findings showed that users had poor recycling habits like taking their waste unclean and buying products with unrecyclable materials. Staff at the recycling point lacked a possibility for a feedback when they received unclean waste.</p>
<p>The new service aims to solve those problems and align
the actor’s interests. A new law makes the supermarket responsible for the waste of the products they sell. So part of the solution contemplates from the supermarket to the user that recycles their products, where the staff can assess if the waste is clean to increase the benefit, empowering them with feedback.</p>

	  	<h4>National Park Service Design - 2017</h4>
	  	<p>The new service is a result of a co-creation process with different users and staff from CONAF. All of the different stages of the service are thought to make the park more accessible for either the elderly, the ones with a visual impediment, the one’s physical disability, and others. The concept was focused on nature immersion and community experience.</p>

	  	<h4>Urban Intervention - 2017</h4>
	  	<p>Walking around the city I came across a beautiful metal sculpture made by an important artist called Rebeca Matte. It is located at the entrance of the most important museum of Santiago, yet people almost didn ́t notice it because
of the contrast between the small size of the sculpture
and the big size of the building.</p>
<p>After a couple of prototypes I identified an important part of the ecosystem, the pigeons, they were active observers of the sculpture. The result was a graphic intervention
on the floor explaining the value of that piece of art,
and writings about its beauty. It also contained food for our birds strategically placed to break the normal flow of the people.</p>

	  	<h4>Oliver - 2015</h4>
	  	<p>Through an ethnographic study we observed that kids with ADHD were highly interested in extreme sports so they usually gave a lot of importance to accessories such as helmets. We also noticed that a big amount of barrels were being wasted in the production of whiskey. So the result, Oliver, is a helmet fabricated through the upcycling of the used barrels of the whiskey production.</p>
